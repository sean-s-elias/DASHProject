Backend is wriiten in .NetCore 8 also has

1 - Middleware exception implemented to handle exceptions
2 - Testing in Xunit
3 - Swagger documentation
4 - Clean Architecture which is an overkill for this project but the reason I have implemented it since we need to consider how to handle 
    lots of users using the application then if we make an assuimption that the application needs be scaled larger then implementing an software architecture is part of the solution


Frontend has the following

1 - Vitejs to build the React app -> https://vitejs.dev
2 - Axios to make calls to the API -> https://axios-http.com/docs/intro
3-  Semantic UI -> https://react.semantic-ui.com/



Note: 
To run the frontend locally then need this command -> npm run dev
